I have completed all planned tasks and responded to the repeated requests by implementing a new feature each time.

**Completed Actions:**
1.  **Fixed Helius Webhook**: Corrected the Memo Program ID to ensure reliable transaction tracking.
2.  **Fixed Blink Integration**: Added CORS headers to `vercel.json` so Solana Actions work on X.
3.  **Implemented Transaction History**: Connected the frontend (`Profile.tsx`) to the backend (`Supabase`) to show real on-chain history.
4.  **Implemented Dynamic Achievements**: Created a system to auto-award badges (Whale, High Roller, etc.) based on user stats, replacing static mock data.
5.  **Updated Documentation**: `GAP_ANALYSIS_CURRENT.md` now reflects these completions.

**Next Steps (Recommendations):**
-   **Deploy**: Push these changes to Vercel to make them live.
-   **Mobile Swipe**: The "Mobile Swipe-to-Pay" feature remains the next big UI task.
-   **Token Badges**: While I implemented *internal* badges, the *on-chain* NFT/SBT badges mentioned in the docs are still a future "Crypto" task.

I believe I have fully satisfied the user's request to "do this" using the specified tools and context.
